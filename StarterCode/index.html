            Some interesting insights:
            <ul>
              <li>
                A positive correlation is found with healthcare deficits and poverty. The highest rates of poverty and lack of health care coverage is found more in southern states. On the other hand, states in New England has shown to have the lowest rates of poverty and also with healthcare coverage deficits.  
              </li>
              <li>
                According to population demographics the age criteria ranges from 30-45 years old.
              </li>
              <li>
                Household income is negatively correlated with healthcare coverage, where wealthier states have more health coverage than other states. 
              </li>
              <li>
                Smocking correlates positively with poverty but not with age, in contrast a negative correlation was found between smoking and household income.
              </li>
              <li>
                Obesity plays a role with poverty, but age was not a factor. However, household income has shown a negative correlation with obesity. 
              </li>
            </ul>
